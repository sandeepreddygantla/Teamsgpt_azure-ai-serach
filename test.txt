We feel like we're good to demo and when I'm also curious beyond like if we demo the prompt and everything like how you got there, if if you can, if we need more time we can do it another time, but I'm anxious.
See what you got.
  Dubba, Jeevan R, So these are the content that are presented in the document according to Jeevan’s prompt.
We got some output from the AI and we.
We store it in the vector database, so in case if you have any like for the files, if we track, download the transcript from the meeting straight, you get a file similar similar to this.
So even if you can upload this file directly and you can start asking questions, whatever the information presented in this document, right?    
So based on that the LLM will answer the your questions about you know.
According to the user's input, you get a response from the LLM.
